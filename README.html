<ol>
<li><p><strong>To run the Lightbox function</strong>, all you have to do is add the class &#8220;lb-js&#8221; to the HTML element you wish to be a trigger. <em>This can be anything from an anchor tag to an img element</em></p></li>
<li><strong>Themes</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Available themes

<ul>
<li>Dark (default)</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Cool</li>
<li>Warm</li>
<li>Custom (with the custom theme, you can use a primary and secondary color, or you can use an image along with a secondary color)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Global Theme is created by using a data-theme=&#8220;yourTheme&#8221; on the body element.
Themes applied to individual elements will override the Global theme.</p>

<p>Supported Content Types: Embed, Image, Video</p>

<p>Content type is called using data-type=&#8220;yourContentType&#8221; on your Lightbox element.</p>

<p>Supported Hosts: Youtube, Vimeo</p>

<p>Hosts are called using data-host=&#8220;yourHost&#8221; on your Lightbox element (only required for embeds).</p>

<p>Lightbox Path: written as data-path=&#8220;yourPath&#8221;, this is the path to the image or video you wish to appear in the Lightbox. data-path=&#8220;auto&#8221; is only available for images and works for both the img element and background images; it removes the need to write out the full path to the image along with data-type=&#8220;img&#8221;</p>
